"""
The FitFindr planning loop.

This is the file that makes FitFindr an agent rather than a script. It decides
which tool to run next based on what the last one returned.

If your loop calls all three tools no matter what comes back, you have a list
of function calls. A loop looks at the last result before it picks the next
step. **That branch is the graded part of this unit.**

Build and test your three tools in `tools.py` first. Then come here.

    python agent.py          runs both example paths below
